  Sebastian Grąz

  Product designer with 6 years of experience. Mostly obsessed with UX, Rapid Prototyping, _Design Systems_ and branding.

  When able, I do implement my own designs in code. I have experience working with vast e-Commerce projects as well as aesthetic campaign websites. I also dabble in animated videos, 3D imagery and audio production.
