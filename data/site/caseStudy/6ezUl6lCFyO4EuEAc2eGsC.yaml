  :textBlock: Indulging into the world of poetry can be quite daunting especially
    for an audience with increasingly short web-attention. At This Place we came up
    with a fresh way to introduce poetry for a new audience - through Memes. In other
    words, a hand-picked poem verse pasted onto an image. With the idea of it being
    shared online

  :textBlock: The home page is adorned with a content slider, featuring a random poetry
    verse matched with Memes that correspond with the verse displayed. It's a smart
    way to show what the website is about at a glance. Reading poetry or explore memes.

    from a size of 16x16 pixels and sometimes smaller. That meant that each icon had
    to be thoughtfully crafted on a 16x16 pixel grid to avoid rendering issues on
    lower-resolution screens
