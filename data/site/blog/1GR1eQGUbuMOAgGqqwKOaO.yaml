  :textBlock: "# Why though\n\n![blog-ratio](//images.contentful.com/y77stanzu634/5rKtzmcTRKcOGy6CcqegMG/d8ca25d2ec9e2a141df417e786e114f1/blog-ratio.png)\n\nGone
    are the days when we simply slap our images onto web pages like so:\n\n\n    <!--
    Don't do this -->\n    <img src=\"images/avo.png\" alt=\"avocado\" />\n\n\nWhy
    is this wrong?\n\nWhen deciding on what image size you should use for your intricate
    product tiles you should instead think about what `ratio` your image should have.\n\n#
    Seriously why though\n\nReason 1 —\nTo avoid re-inventing the wheel it's a good
    idea to constrain the images you are working with to a ratio, which can be reused
    to keep the design more consistent.\n\n\nReason 2 —\nCertain photographs are made
    to be constrained within a certain ratio. So by using ratios we are ensuring the
    image is being presented in the best way possible.\n\nReason 3 —\nFrom a developer
    point of view a big reasons to keep image ratios in mind is the fact that you
    can eliminate page jumps all together whilst the images are loading. This is because
    the image is placed inside a fixed-height div.\nMany call this Lazy Loading, I
    just call it correct usage of image ratios.\n\nWith that said, an implementation
    of an image could look similar to this:\n\n\n    <!-- Do, do this -->\n    <div
    class=\"image r:4x3\">\n      <img src=\"images/avo.png\" alt=\"avocado\" />\n
    \   </div>\n\n\nNotice the CSS includes `object-fit:cover` to help us ensure the
    image is always smugly positioned inside the div. The reason is because we're
    working with a lot of decimals, and sometimes the pixel values get rounded so
    we're just making sure the images always fit.\n\n\n    .r\\:1x3   { padding-top:
    300%; }\n    .r\\:1x2   { padding-top: 200%; }\n    .r\\:2x3   { padding-top:
    150%; }\n    .r\\:3x4   { padding-top: 133.333%; }\n    .r\\:1x1   { padding-top:
    100%; }\n    .r\\:4x3   { padding-top: 75%; }\n    .r\\:2x1   { padding-top: 50%;
    }\n    .r\\:3x1   { padding-top: 33.333%; }\n    \n    .image {\n      overflow:
    hidden;\n      position: relative;\n      img {\n        position: absolute;\n
    \       height: 100%;\n        width: 100%;\n        object-fit: cover;\n      }\n
    \   }\n\n\n`padding-top` sets the height of the image container, which keeps the
    aspect ratio intact. The `.r:` class represent the aspect ratio the image will
    be when placed inside the div.\n\nThere isn't any magic involved so the images
    that you use in your project will need to be exported in the correct aspect ratio.\n\n\n\n"
